	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_3c"		"Jackpot! If you hire two of the same hero, they'll combine to create a more powerful rank 2 Hero! (In some game modes three heroes are needed to combine.)"
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_3d"		"Look at that beefed up Hero. Why do they combine you ask? Good question. Great question. The answer is -- oh hey they're fighting!"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4a"		"Easy peasy. Okay, that’s enough fighting creeps - next round you’ll be up against another crew of heroes. As always, here’s some more gold."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4b"		"You can see your opponent's info in the top left - in a real match you would battle against each other until only one Underlord is left."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4c"		"Ranking up heroes isn't the only way to get stronger. This flashy bit up on the right shows which Alliances your one hero can form."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4c1"		"Each hero can form two to three Alliances - getting the right mix of heroes on your crew can result in strong Alliance buffs."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4c2"		"Right now you don't have any active Alliances. Let’s open the Shop and see if we can hire a hero to complete an Alliance."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4d"		"Nice, looks like you’ll be able to complete one of your Alliances if you hire the highlighted hero! Let’s get them on the team."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4d1"		"Drag your newest crew member onto the board to get them into the fight."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4e"		"Hmm, according to these red bits you can only get one hero onto the board. The number of heroes you can field is equal to your level number."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4f"		"This is your level indicator. You’ll gain 1 XP per round automatically, but you can also buy 5 XP for 5 Gold. Select the button above to buy some XP now."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4g"		"Great! Now you can field another hero on the board. Note that in some game modes you'll automatically level up and won't need to worry about XP."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4h"		"With two heroes and one Alliance, I think we'll do fine in this fight. "

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5a"		"Nice work on your first win against another (bot) player! Since you won, you caused damage to their team, and the Leaderboard has been updated."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5b"		"As always, at the beginning of a round you get gold. This time, you also got a gem. Nice! So what’s a gem?"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5c"		"Hello and welcome to Dota Underlords! It sounds like you already have some experience with building crews and forming Alliances."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5d"		"Just a couple things to cover now that you’re in White Spire - we do things a bit differently in this town."

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_6a"		"You’ll receive gems when you’re on a win-streak or lose-streak. Gems can be socketed into items to make them more powerful."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_6b"		"Items can have Attack, Defense, and Support gems socketed into them - one of each. To socket a gem, drag it onto an item."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_6c"		"There you go. You can tap or hover on the item to check out how it’s improved. "

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7a"		"The final piece is the Underlord, which is to say - you! The Underlord is the leader of the crew, battling for control of White Spire."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7a1"		"Each Underlord has their own play style, strengths, and abilities. Normally you'd get to choose, but we'll pick one for you for now."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7a1_new"	"In every match you'll choose an Underlord after your crew is settled - either Round 2 or Round 10 depending on your game mode. Let's take a look."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7b"		"Each Underlord has their own play style, strengths, and abilities. They'll also come with one of two random Ultimate abilities. Pick one to try out!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7c"		"Your Underlord fights on the board alongside their crew, and they fire off their abilities automatically. Let’s watch!"

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_8a"		"Nice Job, you finished the tutorial!"


	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro2_0"			"Underlords is a game played over many rounds."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro2_1"			"Each round you can hire, fire, and upgrade your heroes before they go to fight."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro2_2"			"This shows your health, experience, and level."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro2_3"			"If you lose a round you lose health.\nIf your health hits zero you're out!"	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro2_4"			"Your level denotes how many heroes you can field at once.\nThe maximum level is 10."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro2_5"			"You gain 1 experience each round but you can spend gold to level up faster."

	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro_0"			"Underlords is simple, be the last player alive."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro_1"			"Hire, sell, and upgrade your heroes before they fight each round."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Intro_2"			"Lose a home game you lose health.\nIf your health hits zero you're out!"

	"DAC_Tutorial_FirstUnit_0"		"You start at level 1.\nLet's hire your first hero. Open the shop."
	"DAC_Tutorial_FirstUnit_1"		"Hire any of the heroes."
	"DAC_Tutorial_FirstUnit_2"		"Now close the shop."
	"DAC_Tutorial_FirstUnit_3"		"The hero is now on your bench.\nYou can keep up to 8 heroes on here."
	"DAC_Tutorial_FirstUnit_4"		"Drag them off your bench and onto the board where they will be ready for combat!"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Fight_0"			"First few rounds are always against creeps to give you an easy start."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Fight_1"			"Let's watch!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_Fight_2"			"You'll earn gold each round, which can be spent in the shop."	

	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_Scene_0"	"Better heroes cost more to hire from the shop."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_Scene_1"	"Hire 3 of the same hero to combine into a more powerful ★★ hero!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_Scene_2"	"Combine 3 ★★ heroes into an almost unstoppable ★★★ hero!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_Scene_3"	"Keep an eye out for your chosen heroes in the shop to prepare for later game combination."

	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_0"		"Hire the highlighted hero to get started combining!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_1"		"Great! To complete the combination, you need the third hero."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_2"		"Refresh the shop to get a new selection of heroes to choose from.\nIt costs 2 gold which we've given you this time!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_3"		"There they are! Hire them to automatically combine into a ★★ hero."	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_4"		"Excellent! Now close the shop."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_5"		"Two star! This next round should be a breeze."
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Combine_6"		"Winning or losing many rounds in a row earns you extra gold."
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_Scene_0"	"Heroes can form two to three Alliances which provide formidable offensive and defensive bonuses."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_Scene_1"	"Match unique heroes sharing the same type to unlock their full potential."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_Scene_2"	"Alliances require a number of unique heroes to activate each level's effect."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_Scene_3"	"Reaching higher Alliance levels will make or break your strategy."

	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_0"		"You can find out the effects of an Alliance by pressing on any Alliance icons."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_1"		"Open the shop, hire two more heroes to get a simple Alliance activated!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_2"		"Close the shop."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_3"		"Drag the heroes onto the board."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Synergy_4"		"Now they're working as a team!"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Items_0"			"Creep waves give rewards for your team or a hero.\nYou don't get to pick if you lose."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Items_1"			"Open your items tab to assign the item to one of your heroes."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Items_2"			"Drag the item to one of your heroes."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Items_3"			"Looking sharp!"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_PlayerWaves_0"	"The next rounds are against other player teams on the left.\nYou will play against each of them in turn."
	"DAC_Tutorial_PlayerWaves_1"	"Try to use combining and creating Alliances in your team to achieve victory."
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_EndScene_0"		"You'll now receive hints and tips for the rest of the match."
	"DAC_Tutorial_EndScene_1"		"You can check The Rulebook for detailed information on heroes, creeps, abilities, and rules."
	"DAC_Tutorial_EndScene_2"		"Go get 'em!"

	"DAC_Tutorial_Interest_0"		"You get 1 gold interest for every 10 (capped at 30) gold at the end of each round in Standard and Duos."

	"DAC_Tutorial_Selling_0"		"You can sell heroes by selecting them and moving them to the sell button."
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_Level_0"			"You can only field as many heroes as your player level."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Level_1"			"To level up faster you can spend 5 gold to get 5xp."
	"DAC_Tutorial_Level_2"			"Saving gold for levelling is a great tactic."

	"DAC_Tutorial_PlaceHero_0"		"You can place as many heroes as your player level.\nMake sure you fill your team!"

	"DAC_Tutorial_Creeps_0"			"Every few rounds you get a creep wave which can reward powerful items."

	"DAC_Tutorial_LoseHealth_0"		"If you lose a home game then you will lose health. If you're reduced to zero then you're out!"

In addition to its regular abilities, every Ace unit offers a new Ace effect that is enabled when you have at least one level of its associated Alliance. When at least one level of that Alliance is enabled, when an Ace unit appears in the Shop, the odds of it being the Ace unit associated with that Alliance is increased by 15%."
	"dac_glossary_alliance"					"Alliance"
	"dac_glossary_alliance_desc"			"Each hero unit is part of one, two, or three Alliances. When they fight on the board alongside other heroes who share the same Alliance, the crew receives an Alliance bonus. This could either make your crew stronger in some way, or your opponent’s crew weaker in some way. Many Alliances have multiple levels of strength that can be reached when you have more unique heroes from that Alliance on your board. For instance a level 1 Brawny Alliance is reached with two heroes, and a level 2 Brawny Alliance can be reached with four heroes. Higher level Alliances offer better benefits to your crew."
	"dac_glossary_gold"						"Gold"
	"dac_glossary_gold_desc"				"Gold is used in Underlords to buy heroes (1-5 gold), reroll the Shop (2 gold), and buy experience (5 gold for 5 XP). Gold can be earned throughout the match in a variety of ways. A base amount of gold is earned after each round regardless of how you did in the last battle. In addition, bonus gold can earned from win streaks, lose streaks, and items. Gold can also be earned through interest – for every 10 gold you have at the beginning of a round up to 30 gold, you will earn 1 extra gold."
	"dac_glossary_hype"						"Hype"
	"dac_glossary_hype_desc"				"Hype is an Underlord's main source of power. As your Underlord gains Hype, their damage output increases (to a max of +50% at full Hype), and ability cooldowns tick faster (up to 40% at full Hype). Hype is generated at a constant rate - and each Underlord has different buffs that allow it to generate faster. Killing your opponent's Underlord grants 2x Hype generation, but getting humiliated by being Stunned or Hexed reduces Hype by 5 each second."
	"dac_glossary_level"					"Player Level"
	"dac_glossary_level_desc"				"When you earn enough XP, you will level up. XP is earned automatically at 1 XP per round, or can be purchased in the Shop - 5XP for 5 gold. Leveling up gives you several bonuses. Your crew count increases along with your level (at level 2 you can field 2 heroes, at level 5, you can field 5). The Shop odds change with your level as well – more powerful heroes will appear in the Shop as you level up."
	"dac_glossary_rank"						"Hero Rank"
	"dac_glossary_rank_desc"				"All heroes hired in the Shop start out as Rank 1. If you hire three of the same hero, they will automatically combine into a Rank 2 hero. Rank 2 heroes not only have more hit points and deal more damage, but their abilities also level up in strength as well. If you create three Rank 2 heroes, they will automatically combine into a Rank 3 hero."
